This file is used for the idea, problems, solutions, and challenges when I coding to solve the problems in the leetcode.

The content is generated from the file .cpp file in the upper directory.

Throughout idea:
1. Which of the following is more important? Achieve the goal or make the algorithms more effecient? 
	* I think both above are important, BUT there is a sequence of these two way. We must achieve the goal and get to what we want, and then we could consider about which implement is more effecient. Additional, we could only modify a part of our code on the basis of achieved goal, thus we could make our coding more effeciently. 
2. The first step of is always producting the input data, e.x. sort, delete repeated data, illegal check etc.
